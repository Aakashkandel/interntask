Vrit Technologies - First Round Task
Overview
In this project, I have developed a server using Node.js and a login interface using React. The objective was to create a functional login system where users can authenticate using specific credentials.

Setup Instructions



cmd:cd server
cmd:npm install
cmd:Start the server:
cmd: nodemon start
The server will be running on http://localhost:9000.

3. Set Up the React Application
Navigate to the React application directory and install the required dependencies:


cmd:cd interntask
cmd:npm install
Start the React application:

cmd:npm start
The React application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Login Details
To access the application, use the following credentials:

Email: tester@gmail.com
Password: Tester12345
Ensure the server is running before attempting to log in to the React application.

Notes
Make sure both the server and React application are running concurrently for full functionality.
If you encounter any issues, please check the server logs and the React application console for errors.
