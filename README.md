# Vrit Technologies - First Round Task

## Overview

In this project, I developed a server using Node.js and a login interface using React. The goal was to create a functional login system where users can authenticate using specific credentials.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Up the Server

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the server directory:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:
    ```bash
    nodemon start
    ```
   The server will be running on [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

### 2. Set Up the React Application

1. Navigate to the React application directory:
    ```bash
    cd interntask
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   The React application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Login Details

To access the application, use the following credentials:

- **Email:** tester@gmail.com
- **Password:** Tester12345

Ensure the server is running before attempting to log in to the React application.

## Notes

- Make sure both the server and React application are running concurrently for full functionality.
- If you encounter any issues, please check the server logs and the React application console for errors.
